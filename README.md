# wordle_game-in-C-CS50-Tutorial-
i'm  trying to create a wordle50 game which is basically  a code  script for the game without a gui in C and it basically if you are not familiar with the game:
# it's a guess game the machine takes a random  word from n.txt  which each (n) stands for number of character in words is named with it's amount of characters  and tells you 3 things :
# Green means right charactrer in rightposition .
# Yellow mean right character but wrong position .
# RED means wrong character.
as the game is built for you have an extra guess for each  type file for example if your fills are 4-character length you will have  5 guesses and so on .
